            <p class="fs-5 fw-light py-4">he Taj Mahal was built between 1631 and 1648 and is the result of the profound love Emperor Shah Jahan had for his wife Mumtaz Mahal. Mumtaj Hahal died during child birth. It took over 20,000 workers and artisans to complete this magnificent structure</p>

            <p class="fs-5 fw-light">The Taj Mahal is a testament to the artistry of Mugal architecture and has a rich history, including surviving wars and natural disasters.
